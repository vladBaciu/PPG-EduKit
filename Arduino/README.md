## Folder structure

<a href="Arduino/common"> Common directory</a> : includes the PPG Edu Kit library for Arduino. The library can be used for creating the applications described in <b> Lab2 </b> and <b> Lab3 </b>.

<a href="Arduino/Lab1"> Lab1 directory </a>: <b> Lab1 </b> helps the user to understand the library architecture by integrating the support for MAX30205 temperature sensor. 
For this lab another code base is provided inside the directory, since the library provided in the <b> common </b> directory has already implemented this functionality.

<a href="Arduino/Lab2"> Lab2 directory </a>: It is a first introduction to the analog filters provided by the platform. The application helps the user to integrate the OLED functionality, 
DMA-ADC buffer readings and push buttons into a final application that displays the PPG signal at different analog stages.

<a href="Ardunio/Lab3"> Lab3 directory </a>: Guides the user on how to display the PPG data over UART using the <b> PPG EduKit GUI </b>.
