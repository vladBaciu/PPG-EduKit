## Folder structure

<b> Common directory </b>: contains the PPG EduKit software packages. 

<b> Solutions directory </b> Includes the PSoC Creator projects (v4.4).

<b> Lab1 directory </b>: Lab1 helps the user to understand the library architecture by integrating the support for MAX30205 temperature sensor. 
For this lab another code base is provided inside the directory, since the library provided in the <b> common </b> directory has already implemented this functionality.

<b> Lab2 directory </b>: Lab2 is a first introduction to the analog filters provided by the platform. The application helps the user to integrate the OLED functionality, 
ADC readings and push buttons into a final application that displays the PPG signal at different analog stages.

<b> Lab3 directory </b>: Lab3 guides the user on how to display the PPG data over UART using the <b> PPG EduKit GUI </b>.

<b> Lab4 directory </b>: Lab4 uses the <b> PPG EduKit GUI </b> GUI to compare the custom solution and the MAX3010x PPG sensor. 

<b> Lab5 directory </b>: Lab5 introduces the SpO2 measurement and different methods to compute the oxygen saturation (embedded + Matlab script)

<b> Lab6 directory </b>: Lab6 includes the BLE configuration for the PSoC board and a generic application on how to write/read data over BLE.
